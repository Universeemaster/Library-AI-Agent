# Library-AI-Agent
A Library AI Agent is an intelligent system designed to assist students in finding the right  learning materials based on their academic needs. It can autonomously analyze user profiles, study  topics, and course syllabi to suggest relevant books and resources. 
<h3>🚀 Overview</h3>

Library AI Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to solve a common academic challenge: helping students and faculty quickly find the most relevant learning materials from the library. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this tool understands student queries in natural language and matches them to suitable books, research material, and syllabi content.

<h3>🧠 Key Features</h3>

🔍 Smart Syllabus Matching: Auto-extracts key topics from syllabi and matches them with books.

💬 Conversational NLP Interface: Ask questions like “What’s a good book for fluid mechanics?”

📖 Real-Time Book Availability: Shows demand status and suggests alternatives.

📝 One-Click Reservations & Waitlisting

🎯 Personalized Recommendations: Based on department, academic year, and history.
